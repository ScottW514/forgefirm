DESCRIPTION = "OpenGlow/ForgeFIRM development image for Glowforge"

# Strict superset of forgefirm-image: everything the main image ships, plus
# debug tooling. forgetest is the release acceptance tool (HTTP :8090) and
# the bench diagnostics page; it belongs to the bench, never to a release
# image (https://docs.forgefirm.org/developers/acceptance/). The gfutilities
# emulator fixtures are the canned frames its service-protocol test answers
# the service with.

# python3-mmap and python3-ctypes serve the bench scripts that read the SoC
# pads through /dev/mem (resume_dark_lead.py, cp_watchdog_timing.py, the
# accelerometer probes). They are bench tooling: the release image carries
# neither, and forgetest itself imports neither.

# The release recipe trims nano from the shared base list (bench
# convenience, 8.7 MB with libmagic); the dev image keeps it. Removal specs
# accumulate and apply after every append, so the variable inside the
# release recipe's spec is what gets blanked here.
FORGEFIRM_RELEASE_TRIM = ""

# debug-tweaks (passwordless root, root SSH login) belongs ONLY to the dev
# image - never the release image. It lives here, not in the shared kas
# local.conf, so the release forgefirm-image cannot inherit it.

# Dev images boot from SD, never from a 200 MiB eMMC slot: lift the slot
# ceiling and give the filesystem generous working space instead.
