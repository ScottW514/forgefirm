SUMMARY = "Boot-slot selection and inventory for Glowforge factory hardware"
DESCRIPTION = "Inventories the bootable partitions (ffboot -l) and switches \
the boot target by rewriting the saved U-Boot environment with read-back \
verification. Ships the fw_env.config for the factory eMMC environment \
layout."

# ffboot rewrites the boot environment on every install and slot switch,
# so it is a fingerprinted component like the daemons: the manifest entry
# records the two files, and the acceptance tests that cover ffboot are
# invalidated when either moves (the installer copies the tool out of the
# rootfs it just wrote).
