# ForgeFIRM image manifest: kernel identity (forgefirm-image-manifest.bbclass
# collects it from DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE). The kernel tree is too large to list
# per file and every acceptance test depends on it anyway, so the entry
# carries the pinned revision and the hash of the configuration actually
# built as pseudo-files ("@srcrev", "@config") that the fingerprint globs
# match like any other path. Device-tree sources and config fragments come
# from the BSP layer, which the image manifest hashes by content.
