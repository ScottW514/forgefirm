"""Host-side verification of the operator-armed window lifecycle.

Runs the native grblHAL_glowforge binary in null-sink mode (no
hardware, no root; arming is automatic without the physical button)
and drives jobs over TCP, asserting the window's state machine on the
reported messages:

  1. the first laser-on of a job arms exactly once, and the window
     persists across M5/M3 toggles within the job (no re-prompt)
  2. program end (M2) closes the window: the disarm lands promptly,
     and the next job arms afresh
  3. a sender change closes the window: a reconnected client must
     re-arm - the displaced session's consent does not carry over
  4. the spindle-off grace counts down in HOLD, not only in Idle - a
     job abandoned in feed hold disarms after laser_disarm_s
  5. arming is refused while the cooling verdict blocks fire, and no
     armed message appears
  6. with a switch source present (GF_SWITCH_FILE), the arm blocks on the
     button: a press with the lid closed arms, and the lid or the
     interlock loop opening during the wait cancels the job (a clean
     soft reset, no alarm; latch relocked, never armed)
  7. outside the arm wait the button is the pause/resume toggle: a press
     while running feed-holds, a press while held resumes; the arming
     press itself is not a pause press
  8. the lid or the interlock loop opening mid-job cancels the job (the
     default lid_policy): reason reported, armed window closed, a soft
     reset with the position kept (no alarm), the head returns to the
     job start on its own; with lid_policy = hold the stock door hold and
     cycle-start resume apply
  9. the job start survives a pause: a job paused and resumed by the
     button, then cancelled by the lid, returns to where the job began,
     not to where it was paused (the core restarts a held cycle through
     Idle); a job abandoned in a hold and reset ends there, so the next
     job's start is captured afresh where it begins

The disarm grace is shortened via a temp config (GFHOME_CONF), the
cooling verdict is published hermetically (GF_VERDICT_FILE), the same
overrides the emission harness uses, and the switches are driven through
the file-backed test source (GF_SWITCH_FILE: the EV_SW word as an integer).
