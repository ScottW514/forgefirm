"""Host-side verification of the laser pulse-stream emission.

Runs the native grblHAL_glowforge binary in null-sink mode with
GFSINK_DUMP capturing the shipped byte stream, drives small laser jobs
over TCP, then checks the dumps against the kernel feeder contract:

  1. a power byte (bit 7) leads the stream, before any tick byte
  2. no two consecutive power bytes (the SDMA script drops the second)
  3. the first FIRE bit (0x10) comes after a nonzero power byte
  4. power values match the S words through the core's mapping, floor
     included ($30=1000, $31=0, $35 = the board's floor), and no duty
     under FIRE falls below that floor
  5. FIRE only spans the cutting moves: none before the job, none during
     the G0 return, none at the tail
  6. step accounting survives the insertions: X returns to net zero and
     peaks at the programmed 10 mm
  7. termination: every stream ends with FIRE clear, including an M3
     (constant-power) job whose core never issues a laser-off update -
     the stream must never lean on the kernel's end-of-data backstop
  8. no FIRE bit ever rides a zero-step gap: a stepless run of stream
     bytes carrying FIRE longer than any legitimate between-step
     interval is a stationary dwell burn
  9. rules 7-8 hold across rapid cycle stop/start churn (planner-starve
     shaped jobs), where the FIRE state of the previous cycle must not
     leak into the idle-gap pad bytes
 10. a power ladder fires every rung at the duty commanded for it: no
     FIRE tick rides a duty that was never commanded (a run start resets
     the hardware duty to ~100 %, so a fire bit reaching the stream
     ahead of the rung's power byte would burn at full power), and the
     fire ticks divide evenly across the rungs, which is what fails if a
     rung's opening ticks carry the previous rung's duty
 11. under the density dose model no level ever reaches PWMSAR: every
     power byte carries full duty (one still leads each kernel run), and
     a level change inside a run costs no stream byte at all
 12. density matches the level the core commanded, rung by rung, and no
     burst is longer than the base period
 13. the model is a mask and never a source: run the same job under both
     models and every FIRE tick of the density run is a FIRE tick of the
     analog run, on an identical motion grid
 15. the minimum pulse width holds: no emitted burst is shorter than
     laser_pulse_min_ticks, and the levels too faint to fill it still
     render their exact average density - the debt is carried, so a low
     level becomes fewer full-width pulses rather than stubs
 14. a laser state change made while the stream is idle survives to the
     next run: a standalone S word between moves, from a sender slow
     enough to drain the planner, must still cut at the level it asked
     for rather than dark at a stale duty
 16. and the off transition survives the same way: an M5 executed with
     the planner drained and the kernel run over must darken the rapids
     that follow it, and a bare G0 sent with the spindle off must ship
     dark, under both dose models - the stream's wanted fire state is
     the only thing those moves consult, and a stale true there lights
     the next run at the last level (full duty under density)
 17. and a job's first cut at the level the previous job ended at
     fires: S is modal across M2, the core records the level a set_state
     carries and skips the per-segment update while it is unchanged, so
     the M3 that opens the next job is the only thing that can light its
     first move - set_state must push the whole state, fire included,
     never the duty alone
 18. the floor is derived, never typed: $35 is loaded from the floor
     key at every precompute, so a $35 typed by the sender is
     overwritten - the ladder renders through the key's floor, and the
     arm report names the model, the floor and the curve in force
 19. the dose curve bends S onto the density that delivers the
     commanded light fraction: with the bench-default curve in force a
     ladder of S rungs renders the curve's densities (half light lands
     near 80 percent density), monotonic, floored and ceiled by
     $35/$36; every other session runs with laser_dose_curve = off so
     its S-to-level arithmetic stays exact

The analog sessions select the reference mode through the config; on
hardware the controller ignores it (density is the only product model -
analog's strike transient puts a spot at every beam-on), but the
null-sink build honors it so these rules can hold the density model to
account against the continuous rendering (rule 13's mask above all).
