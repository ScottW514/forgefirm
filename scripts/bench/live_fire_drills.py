"""Live-fire bench drills - Phases 4, 5, 6. Runs on the board (the bench
page) or from a LAN host, against grblHAL over TCP (port 23) and
forgectrl over HTTP (:8080); the machine is GF_HOST, default 127.0.0.1.
LIVE LASER: the operator must be armed with eye protection, a fire
watch, an extinguisher, and the exhaust running. Every drill waits for
the operator to press the physical arm button before the machine fires;
nothing here defeats that gate.

Usage: live_fire_drills.py <drill> [arg] [F]  (ircut/pthresh take S,
       dladder takes the base period in machine ticks, pcurve takes
       F, the line length and an optional rung list)

Drills (pass a name):
  witness   Phase 5 A-1/A-2/A-5: a short vector mark at S400. Samples
            forgectrl /status (emission_samples, lid_ir[], hv_current)
            and /cool/status (armed, fire_watch) at ~8 Hz through the
            job. PASS: emission_samples goes nonzero during the fire
            window and returns to 0; lid_ir peak recorded per channel
            vs the ambient baseline; hv_current range logged. Also
            asserts X-3: armed drops at Idle with the job close, not at
            +60 s.
  hold      Phase 4 G-10: arm + start a longer job, feed-hold mid-run,
            then hold. PASS: the disarm grace counts down in Hold and
            the window closes (armed -> false) without the job resuming.
  ircut     Lid-IR fire characterization at cutting power: a 30 mm
            square at S<power> (default 1000 = full) and F<feed>
            (default 300) on scrap, sampled like `witness`. Prints the
            per-channel peak delta over the ambient baseline and the
            engine's own "run telemetry" line is the record. Run it
            >= 3 times on representative material; the highest peaks
            are what the engine's cool_fire_q1/q2 alert and critical
            thresholds (absolute counts) must sit above.
              ircut [S] [F]             e.g. ircut 1000 300
  pthresh   Laser power-threshold ladder: one line per power level on
            scrap, climbing from 2 % to 30 % of full, at constant power
            (M3) so nothing scales the duty with velocity. The ladder
            separates two thresholds that are far apart: the discharge
            strikes at a duty well below the one the tube lases at, and
            the rungs between them show only a spot at the line start
            (the strike transient) with a dark line after it. The
            lowest rung that leaves a CONTINUOUS mark is the lasing
            threshold, and because $35 is a percent of full duty and
            the rungs are percents of $30 with $31 = 0, that rung's
            percent IS the $35 value. Requires $35 = 0 for the run: a
            floor already in place lifts every rung and hides both
            thresholds.
              pthresh [Smax] [F]        e.g. pthresh 1000 300
  dladder   Density ladder for the FIRE-bit dose model: one line per
            dose level on scrap, 5 % to 100 %, at constant power (M3)
            so nothing scales the dose with velocity. Under this model
            the duty is pinned at full and the level is carried by how
            many ticks of each base period fire, so a rung's burst is
            density x period - and the base period is the parameter the
            host cannot choose for you. Run it at 20, then 40, then 10
            on the same material: 20 ticks is 710 us, the factory's
            ~1.43 kHz, and 40 and 10 bracket it. Two questions the
            material answers: does mark depth track density linearly,
            and how short a burst still marks. Requires
            laser_power_model = density; reads $30/$31/$35/$36 and
            reports the mapping, so a run with a density floor set shows
            what a shipped machine would actually emit. Sets
            laser_pulse_ticks itself when run on the board.
              dladder [period] [F]      e.g. dladder 20 300
  pcurve    Laser performance-curve ladder, both instruments: one line
            per level at constant feed (default F600, 10 mm/s, 100 mm),
            M3 constant power, the laser off between rungs and a
            mid-ladder rung repeated at the end as the drift witness. Reads
            the HV current and the head thermopile (a scatter detector
            in the beam path upstream of the final mirror, so it sees
            the beam, not the material) straight from sysfs at ~25 Hz
            while the machine runs, brackets each rung on the
            controller's Run/Idle states, and reports per rung the
            current (mean, spread, max, CLIPPED at 1023), the thermopile
            delta over its laser-off baseline with its in-line drift,
            the digital flag's duty and the coolant temperature; then
            the normalized curve, a monotonicity check, a straight-line
            fit with its x-intercept as the measured threshold, and the
            repeat-rung comparison. Rungs follow laser_power_model:
            analog 16..100 % of duty (dense at the knee), density
            1..100 %; a comma list overrides. Records the actual level
            each S lands on from $30/$31/$35/$36; measuring the curve
            itself wants $35 = 0. JSON record (with the raw trace) in
            FORGETEST_BENCH_DATA, else /tmp. Runs on the board for the
            thermopile; from a host it falls back to /status (current
            only, no curve). Reaches FULL power for 10 s per line.
              pcurve [F] [len] [pcts]   e.g. pcurve 600 100 16,20,30,50,100
  m5dark    The rapids after an M5 ship dark: one 20 mm line at M3 S400,
            M5, a dwell, a rapid back over the line, a dwell, a rapid
            forward, a dwell, M2. Samples sysfs at 25 Hz (board only):
            PASS when the current shows exactly one discharge segment,
            reads dark after the M5, and laser_on_sampled never goes
            nonzero again after its first zero past the line. Prints the
            9 s after the line at 40 ms steps. The catalog's
            laser.m5-rapid-dark is its port.
  m4corner  M4 velocity-scaled power into corners and short segments:
            a corner-heavy vector pattern (a long line, 1.1 mm zigzag
            teeth, a 2 mm square, a 180 degree reversal, 0.5 mm teeth)
            at 30 %% under M4 at F2000, one pass under density. The
            floor is the guard: velocity brings the commanded power to
            the floor at every corner, and the model cannot go dark by
            construction - the operator confirms every commanded
            segment marks. One discharge window, dark after.
              m4corner [S] [F]   e.g. m4corner 300 2000
  m4feeds   B3, the density time base across feeds: under M4 density,
            one out-and-back 20 mm line pair per feed (default 1000 and
            4000 mm/min) at the same S, passes offset +Y, one armed
            run. M4 scales the commanded power with velocity inside a
            move, so each line should read evenly dark from its slow
            ends to its fast middle; the reversal point is where the
            factory's own compensation still let dose per mm rise
            ~1.8x. The operator compares evenness within each pass and
            the reversal darkness across the two feeds. Requires
            laser_power_model = density.
              m4feeds [S] [F1] [F2]   e.g. m4feeds 600 1000 4000
  dpatch    Depth witness for the dose curve of the configured
            laser_power_model: two rows of small engraved patches
            (serpentine G1 fills) on the stock. Row A is CW (S1000) at
            feeds giving relative doses 1.0 to 0.25 of the reference
            feed; row B is 100/80/60/45/30 %% density or duty at the
            reference feed. Match each row-B patch to the row-A patch
            of equal depth by eye: that reads the model's light
            fraction off the material, next to what the thermopile
            says it should be. Samples sysfs at 25 Hz like pcurve;
            JSON record in the bench data directory.
              dpatch [F] [pitch] [length]   e.g. dpatch 1500 0.3 30
  flowload  Cooling under laser load, one armed run per invocation, the
            conf keys it writes put back when the run ends; the pump is
            never commanded off. `t1` reproduces the flow-check trip:
            the check ON at its defaults (50 s window, 14.4 C limit,
            150 s re-check) and two 30 x 4 mm serpentine fills at F1500
            CW starting on the press with no dark dwell, so the tube is
            lit for about 35 s of the window; reports the engine's own
            rise/dT verdict beside the 25 Hz trace of both coolant
            sensors, the current, the digital witness and the heater
            output, in 5 s bins across the window, and the shape at
            fire start (a common-mode step is electrical, a lagged ramp
            is thermal). `t2 <secs> [pct]` turns the check OFF for the
            run (cool_flow_check_s = 0) and fires one fill of about
            <secs> lit seconds at CW, or at <pct> density; reports the
            lag to each sensor, the rise per raw-second of hv_current
            (k) and what a full 50 s window would add against the 1.6 C
            margin. `fit` reads every t2 record in the bench data dir
            and fits rise against dose. JSON records like dpatch.
              flowload t1 | flowload t2 <secs> [pct] | flowload fit
  senderchg A sender change mid-job: a 20 mm line at F60 lit on the
            press, the connection dropped five seconds in, the job held
            where it stopped, a reconnect, then ~ from the new session,
            which must light the button and wait. PASS: the hold, the
            resume prompt, no lit sample between the drop and the second
            press, the rest of the line marks. Two presses; JSON record.
  holdres   Feed hold and resume, the pause as a corner in time: a 30 mm
            M4 line held near 10 mm and resumed, then a 90 degree corner
            to compare the marks; the same hold under M3 on the return
            line (no dark lead on the resume); then a hold past the
            disarm grace, resumed with ~ through the re-arm prompt. Two
            presses: the arm, and the re-arm after the long hold.
  overrun   An RX overrun mid-job: a 20 mm line at F60 lit on the press,
            a 93-line fill written at once three seconds in (about 1270
            bytes against the 1023-byte ring). PASS: the controller
            reports the overrun, stops in alarm with the window closed
            and emission ending at the alarm; after $X a fresh M3 prompts
            for the button again and a 5 mm line marks. Two presses.
  expstop   Armed kill on the EXPECTED-stop path: start a mark job,
            then mid-burn POST /controller/stop (the supervisor stops
            the controller: SIGTERM, reap, exit safing). PASS: emission
            drops to 0 within a few samples of the stop and stays 0,
            the kernel is not running, and POST /controller/start
            is a SEPARATE step (`ctrlstart`, run after the operator has
            judged the stop). Needs the panel token: GF_TOKEN, or
            /data/forgefirm/panel.token when running on the board.
  ctrlstart POST /controller/start after an expstop; no motion, no laser.

The G-4 arm-refuses-when-a-fire-gate-is-active drill is operator-manual
(kill the pump during the button wait); this harness prints the cue.

# (M3) the dose per unit area is light x time, so a row of CW patches
# (S1000: the discharge continuous) at feeds F600/dose is a reference
# ladder of known relative dose, and a row of density patches at F600 is
# matched to it by engrave depth. The CW patch a density patch matches
# reads that density's light fraction straight off the stock, with the
# thermopile's prediction printed beside it. The lines alternate
# direction so no rapid crosses a fill; judge the middle of each patch,
# since under constant power the ends carry the acceleration and read
# darker at the fast feeds.

# --- cooling under laser load: the flow check with the tube lit --------------

# cool_flow_heater_pct, judged on the downstream rise against cool_flow_rise)
# ran while the first dpatch patch fired CW through its window and read 15.1 C
# against 14.4, a SUSPECT that held the job. The defaults go back into the
# conf for the run and the burst starts on the press with no dark dwell, so
# the tube is lit for most of the window. Test 2 turns the check off for the
# run and fires one burst of a chosen length, so the trace holds the tube's
# heat alone: the lag to the sensors, the rise per raw-second of hv_current,
# and its shape (a step at fire start is electrical, a lagged ramp is
# thermal). Each invocation is ONE armed run; the conf keys it writes are put
# back when the run ends, and the engine re-reads them at the next run start.
# The pump is never commanded off here.

# lines: an engrave, not a burn), sized by the seconds the tube is to be lit.
