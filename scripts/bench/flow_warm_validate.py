"""Validate the flow check at a WARM loop baseline - the condition a
real job actually presents.

Every design-matrix run started near ambient (21-23 C). During a cut the
loop sits warmer, where heat loss to ambient is larger, which shrinks
the measured rise in BOTH the flow and no-flow cases and could compress
the margin the threshold depends on. This warms the loop with its own
heater (which plateaus near 28-29 C - the most it can reach unaided),
then runs the real check at 40% / 50 s with the cut-profile fans, and
alternates flow / no-flow so both cases see the same conditions.

Drives the heater, pump and fans directly: run with forgectrl and the
controller stopped (the bench page's takeover does that; from a host,
stop them first). Runs on the board or from a host (gfbench: GF_HOST).
Results and the log go to the bench data directory (gfbench.data_path).

Usage: flow_warm_validate.py [cycles_per_case] [target_c] [warm_budget_min]
       (defaults 3, 28.0, 20: the loop's own heater at 50 percent plateaus
       near 28 to 29 C in a 20 C room, the most a warm baseline can be
       without the tube)
