"""Characterize a SHORT periodic flow re-check for use DURING a job.

Why a separate design from the job-start check: with the laser firing
and coolant flowing, tube heat raises BOTH sensors, inflating a plain
downstream-rise metric toward a false fault. With the pump stopped that
heat never reaches the sensors at all (stagnant loop), so the no-flow
signature stays at its idle value. The two signatures therefore
converge during a cut. The differential rise

    (downstream_end - downstream_start) - (upstream_end - upstream_start)

cancels that common-mode heating and is the metric this measures.

TWO DEAD ENDS, recorded so they are not re-invented:

1. Absolute over-temperature does NOT detect a failed pump. The
   sensors read the water at their own location; with no circulation
   the tube's heat stays in the tube and never reaches them. The loop
   can read perfectly comfortable while the tube cooks. Over-temp
   monitoring detects a hot CIRCULATING loop - a different failure.

2. "The coolant should warm up while cutting" is NOT a usable
   indicator either. A low-duty engrave (say 5% duty at 30% power) can
   put so little heat in that the cooling system absorbs it with no
   measurable rise, so a flat trend is equally consistent with a light
   load working correctly and with a dead pump. Ambiguous evidence is
   worse than none - it invites false confidence.

Hence: periodic ACTIVE interrogation with the heater, which creates a
known stimulus instead of waiting for one, is the only valid method on
this hardware (there is no pump tach or pump current sense anywhere in
the machine).

Usage: flow_recheck_char.py [heater_pct] [window_s]   (default 50 30)
Runs both flow and no-flow cases from a comparable loop state and
prints the differential separation. Aborts if downstream passes 45 C.
