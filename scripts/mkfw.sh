# Packs a ForgeFIRM rootfs.ext4 into a fwup .fw archive with the factory
# update task layout: upgrade.a / upgrade.b raw-write the rootfs into eMMC
# slot p1 / p2 (fwup is invoked with -d /dev/mmcblk2p<N>, so offsets are
# partition-relative, exactly like the factory updater).
#
# Usage: mkfw.sh <rootfs.ext4> <version> <output.fw> [private-key]
#   FWUP=<path> overrides the fwup binary (any 1.x; archives verified to
#   apply with the factory's fwup 0.14.2).
#   Unsigned output (no key) is for dev only: release and updater paths
#   require a signature.
