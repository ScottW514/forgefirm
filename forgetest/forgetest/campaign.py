"""Campaign rules: which results apply, what is required, and whether a
release is authorized.

A campaign is bound to one image (manifest content hash) and one catalog
(catalog hash). It is open from its record until a FAIL/ERROR result in
it, an invalidate-all, an explicit reset, or a different image or
catalog. Rules per test T with domain fingerprint F(T):

  satisfied by campaign  a PASS in the open campaign with fingerprint F(T)
  satisfied by inheritance  (never for the always-required core) the newest
                         PASS anywhere in the history with fingerprint F(T)
                         and newer than the last invalidate-all
  required               otherwise (reason: always / never-passed /
                         domain-changed)

  authorized  <=>  a campaign is open and every catalog test is satisfied

Pure functions over the record list; nothing here touches hardware or
the filesystem, which keeps the rules unit-testable and lets the release
gate reason with the same code.
