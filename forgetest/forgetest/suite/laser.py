"""laser.* - LIVE laser tests, ported from `scripts/bench/live_fire_drills.py`.

Every test here can emit, except `laser.power-floor`, which only reads
settings. The page starts a firing one only with the operator's
eye-protection / fire-watch / exhaust acknowledgment; the test then
prompts for the scrap and the button, streams a small job through the
controller, and the machine fires only after the operator presses the
physical arm button - nothing here defeats that gate, and forgetest
never touches the laser latch. One emission per test; on abort or error
the job is soft-reset (`^X`: controlled stop, latch relocked). The
witnesses are forgectrl's `/status` (`laser.emission_samples` = the
kernel's LASER_ON sample count, `hv_current_raw`, `lid_ir`),
`/cool/status` (`armed`), the head's beam detector
(`head/beam_detect_analog`, the tube's own emission seen from the head:
a few hundred counts over its idle level while the beam is on, and
`beam_detect_digital` asserted), and the button LEDs (lit while the arm
waits or the window is open, dark after the disarm) - all sampled at
~8 Hz through the arm -> fire -> disarm lifecycle. The one thing the
operator still judges by eye is the mark the emission witness leaves,
once per campaign: the calibration of the sensor witnesses.
