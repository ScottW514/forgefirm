"""Coverage lint: every source path in the manifest must be selected by
some test's coverage globs, except the allowlisted non-behavioral paths,
and every coverage glob must select at least one path of its component.

Why a hard rule: under the domain model an uncovered file is worse than an
untested one - a change there leaves every inherited PASS valid when it
should have invalidated them. The lint is the floor (the file is
fingerprinted by at least one test); whether that test exercises the
change stays with the change author. An entry that selects nothing is
the same defect from the other side: the test's fingerprint ignores the
file it named.

  python3 -m forgetest.coverage [--manifest PATH] [--enforce] [--json]

Exit 0 when nothing is uncovered (or when only reporting), 1 under
--enforce with uncovered paths, 2 on a usage or load error.
