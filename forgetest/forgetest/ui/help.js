 * Every explanation the page offers lives here, keyed by the data-help
 * attribute of the "?" button that opens it (index.html): a title, its
 * paragraphs, and the page of the documentation site it deep-links to
 * (DOC_BASE + d). The buttons open Bootstrap popovers, one at a time; a
 * click anywhere else, Escape, or a tab change closes the open one. The
 * buttons sit on static elements only: the rows, prompts and tool entries
 * are rebuilt by app.js, and a popover on one of those would be orphaned.
 * What the operator must read mid-run (the steps, prompts, notices and
 * the live-laser acknowledgment) stays in the page and never moves here.
